# dungeon-dice-master

I want to do a dungeons and dragon game where the game generates a character for the user using random characteristics. the game can use the advanced dungeons and dragons rule set and after it tells the player its character runs them through scenarios and acts a dungeon master for the player. The game can roll and show the dice rolls to the player that are used for different results based on the actions that the player decides to take.
